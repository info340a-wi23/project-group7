                  <h5>Hike Description (from <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/pacific-crest-trail-section-j-snoqualmie-pass-to-stevens-pass-east#hike-full-description">WTA</a>)</h5>
                  <p>This route traverses the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and the trail passes by a least a dozen lakes along the way, many of them swimmable in late-summer. But the lakes aren't the only attraction. Hikers here encounter meadows, old-growth trees, and stunning views of towering mountains.</p>
                  <p>This trail is not for the beginning backpacker. There is considerable elevation gain and loss - about 16,000 feet! Some places are impassable until well into August when the snow melts out. And the distance requires hikers to carry six or seven days of food and arrange for a car shuttle or pick-up at Stevens Pass.</p>
                  <p>Beginning from the Snoqualmie Pass trailhead, hikers plunge into the stunning high country, starting off Day 1 out of this trailhead with a trek across the Kendall Katwalk. As you head further north, you may find some relative solitude, but this section is popular and accessible from both ends, so plan your outing accordingly; it may be hard to find a suitable place to camp, but please abide by Leave No Trace principles, and personify good trail etiquette.</p>
                  <p>Check out our <a href="training1.html">training page</a> to prepare for this trail!</p>

                     <p>The following text is from a WTA post by Adrian H.</p>
                     <p>My wife and I and two friends just completed the PCT Section J in 6-days, 5-nights going south to north from Snoqualmie to Steven's Pass.  The weather was spectacular, the bugs mild, the night skies inspiring, the lake swims refreshing, and the scenery world class.  We hiked 10 to 14 miles per day averaging 12 miles per day and camped at Joe Lake, Lemah Ford, the Waptus River, the Cle Elum River, and Trap Lake (lots of ripe blueberries).  Bugs were not an issue at any of these campsites and along most of the trail.  We did encounter a few mosquitoes at Deception Lake and had reports from other backpackers that the bugs were still ferocious there so it might be wise to skip that campsite.</p>
                     <p>We encountered a large number of PCT thru hikers while on the trail.  If you're not in a hurry, we recommend getting to your target campsite between 2pm to 4pm to increase your chances of getting a good spot.  Thru hikers would generally arrive looking for sites after 5pm.  You can also target camp locations just off the main PCT trail (0.1 to 0.3 miles) including Spectacle Lake, Pete's Lake, Glacier Lake or Trap Lake which are less popular with thru hikers.  You get the added benefit of cooling off with afternoon swims in the lake or dips in the river.</p>
                     <p>If you do end up at Spectacle Lake, be warned that the 'Old Spectacle Lake Trail' located on the northeast side of the lake is very difficult to follow back to the main PCT.  We had to bushwhack through thick undergrowth and do some rock scrambling to find the trail down which ended up taking us a solid hour and a half.  Your best bet is to return to the PCT via the main connector trail located on the southeast side of the lake.  If you do attempt the Old Trail, make sure you look for cairns once you emerge on the cliff tops located a few hundred yards from the PCT.  The cairns will lead you down to a steep, rocky trail that navigates you below the sheer cliffs you're standing on and back down to the PCT.</p>
