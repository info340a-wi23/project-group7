   <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Hiking Web Application</h2>

      <h3>Problem and Data Domain</h3>
   </div>
   <div>
      <h3>App Description</h3>
      <p>While using the app, users can interact with several types of information. The first is a map of local hikes filterable by length, difficulty, features, and location. For example, a user might search for hikes that are between three and four miles roundtrip, are moderately difficult, have mountains and waterfalls, and are within 30 miles of Baring, WA. The second is hike-specific information, which includes both officially published and user-shared reports and reviews. Users can also post pictures of the hike in their reports as a method of sharing information about the hike's condition; for example, if someone went on a hike to Barclay Lake and saw several fallen logs that made the trail less passable, they might want to put that in their report and include a picture of it. The last is training tips for various hike overall difficulties with workouts and workout combinations grouped together based off of hike length and elevation gain. For example, if someone wanted to try hiking a section of the Pacific Crest trail, they might want to train by doing stair drills and long-distance running.</p>
      <p>TL;DR: Available information for users includes:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>A filterable map of local hikes</li>
         <li>Hike-specific information and user-shared reports</li>
         <li>Training tips for hikes based on difficulty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This web app will solve the issue of hike preparedness by providing users with three primary features. The first and most prominent of these is a method of sharing and seeing the most up-to-date information about a hike so that users can be prepared mentally for what it has to offer and any challenge it may present. The second feature is adequate information on how to prepare physically for a hike or to measure whether or not a user's physical strength and endurance is on par with the hike's difficulty level and length. The last feature is a way of saving and organizing future and completed hikes in one convenient online location. These features will allow users to gather as much relevant information about a hike as possible so that they can be adequately prepared for everything the hike has to offer.</p>
