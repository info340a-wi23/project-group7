   <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Hiking Web Application</h2>

      <h3>App Description</h3>
      <p>We believe that our app can be catered towards a wide range of hikers, from absolute beginners to skillful experts. Both of these groups can equally benefit from the features of getting tips from others to exploring new hikes that they may have not heard of. This app will not severely impact minority groups because, although it is beneficial for newer hikers to learn from experts, it is not necessary for them to still learn about hiking on their own. </p>
      <p>Novice hikers may find this app extremely beneficial with getting tips from expert hikers about properly training for hikes, learning about safe trail conditions, and exploring the diverse trails in their area. On the other hand, more experienced hikers may use this app to coach newer hikers and provide them with personal advice about everything there is to know about hiking, while also using the same features to learn from other experts. One of the interactive features of this app will be the ability to filter the kinds of hikes users are interested in. They will be able to filter by length of the hike, difficulty, location, and more. Our second interactive feature we will implement is the ability for users to review certain hikes they completed by posting pictures or leaving comments under it. Lastly, we will add a feature for users to interact with each other and provide expert advice about how to train for certain hikes.</p>
      <p>While using the app, users can interact with several types of information. The first is a map of local hikes filterable by length, difficulty, features, and location. For example, a user might search for hikes that are between three and four miles roundtrip, are moderately difficult, have mountains and waterfalls, and are within 30 miles of Baring, WA. The second is hike-specific information, which includes both officially published and user-shared reports and reviews. Users can also post pictures of the hike in their reports as a method of sharing information about the hike's condition; for example, if someone went on a hike to Barclay Lake and saw several fallen logs that made the trail less passable, they might want to put that in their report and include a picture of it. The last is training tips for various hike overall difficulties with workouts and workout combinations grouped together based off of hike length and elevation gain. For example, if someone wanted to try hiking a section of the Pacific Crest trail, they might want to train by doing stair drills and long-distance running.</p>
      <p>TL;DR: Available information for users includes:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>A filterable map of local hikes</li>
         <li>Hike-specific information and user-shared reports</li>
         <li>Training tips for hikes based on difficulty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This web app will solve the issue of hike preparedness by providing users with three primary features. The first and most prominent of these is a method of sharing and seeing the most up-to-date information about a hike so that users can be prepared mentally for what it has to offer and any challenge it may present. The second feature is adequate information on how to prepare physically for a hike or to measure whether or not a user's physical strength and endurance is on par with the hike's difficulty level and length. The last feature is a way of saving and organizing future and completed hikes in one convenient online location. These features will allow users to gather as much relevant information about a hike as possible so that they can be adequately prepared for everything the hike has to offer.</p>
